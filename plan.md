Below is a comprehensive, end-to-end step list for implementing CodeSight as an autonomous MCP-powered agent:

Study and onboard MCP fundamentals
– Read the Model Context Protocol spec (JSON-RPC structure, tool registration, context schema) 
en.wikipedia.org
.
– Explore reference MCP servers and SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java) in Anthropic’s GitHub.

Define agent capabilities as MCP tools
– List every function your agent needs:

ingest_html – accept raw HTML or screenshot + DOM.

parse_dom – build a standardized DOM tree.

generate_selectors – propose CSS/XPath given target spec.

build_script – render Puppeteer/Playwright boilerplate.

execute_script – run headless in sandbox, return results/errors.

validate_output – check for completeness and correctness.

record_feedback – log user corrections and runtime anomalies.

train_selector_model – batch fine-tuning pipeline.

Design MCP tool contracts
– For each tool, specify the JSON-RPC method name, input schema, output schema, and error codes.
– Version your tool definitions to support backward-compatible evolution.

Select or implement an MCP server
– Choose Anthropic’s reference MCP server (supports custom tool plugins) or build one using the MCP SDK 
en.wikipedia.org
.
– Configure secure channels, authentication, and permissions for registered tools.

Develop and register each MCP tool
– Code handler functions in Node.js or Python:

HTML ingestion: sanitize inputs, extract DOM.

DOM parser: use a library (e.g. Cheerio, jsdom).

Selector generator: wrap LLM calls behind an MCP method.

Script builder & executor: integrate Playwright in Docker containers.

Validation & feedback: compare results to spec, store logs in a database.
– Register these handlers with the MCP server’s registry.

Set up the LLM client as an MCP tool
– Expose a call_model method for planning and selector reasoning, configured to use GPT-4o-Vision (for DOM + screenshot) or GPT-4 Turbo (text only).
– Implement prompt templates with few-shot examples for HTML→selector→script workflows.

Implement the agent orchestration loop
– In your agent client, define the high-level plan() → execute() → validate() → learn() cycle.
– Use MCP’s dynamic discovery to list available tools and invoke them by method name.

Provision sandboxed execution infrastructure
– Dockerize Playwright environments with tight resource and network controls.
– Ensure each execute_script call runs in isolation and respects robots.txt/legal constraints.

Build the feedback and memory subsystem
– Store user corrections, runtime exceptions, and pattern successes in a “Pattern Repository” (e.g. MongoDB).
– Expose an MCP tool for retrieving and updating this repository.

Develop the offline training pipeline
– Periodically sample logged interactions to fine-tune the selector generation model.
– Expose this as an MCP tool train_selector_model, invoked by a scheduler or CI job.

Write comprehensive integration tests
– Simulate full workflows against a suite of test websites.
– Validate tool contracts, error handling, retries, and accuracy thresholds.

Deploy MCP server and agent clients
– Use Kubernetes or serverless containers; configure autoscaling based on request load.
– Set up secure ingress (TLS, authentication) and service meshes as needed.

Instrument monitoring and observability
– Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics: request latency, success rates, tool error counts.
– Centralize logs (ELK or CloudWatch) with audit trails of each MCP call.

Implement security and compliance safeguards
– Enforce per-tool permissions and rate limits.
– Validate that scraping respects robots.txt and site TOS before executing.

Document tool APIs and developer guides
– Publish MCP method reference, example calls, and sample scripts.
– Provide SDK wrappers for common languages.

Onboard beta users and collect feedback
– Share instruction sets, usage examples, and error-reporting channels.
– Iterate on tool specs, prompts, and deployment configs based on real-world usage.

Scale to production and iterate
– Add caching for common site patterns.
– Tune LLM prompts and retry logic to hit your accuracy and latency goals.
– Plan regular audits of security and model performance.

By following these steps, you’ll leverage MCP to modularize every part of your autonomous scraping agent—making it easier to extend, secure, and maintain as the web evolves.

so will this be able to run autonmously when called


ChatGPT said:
Yes. Once you’ve implemented the MCP-powered CodeSight agent as described, invoking its “generate” endpoint or CLI will kick off the entire pipeline—end-to-end and without any human in the loop. Here’s how autonomy plays out in practice:

Single Call Invocation

CLI

bash
Copy
Edit
codesight generate \
  --html page.html \
  --target "product title, price" \
  --output scrape.js
HTTP API

http
Copy
Edit
POST /v1/agent/run
{
  "html": "<!DOCTYPE…>",
  "target": ["product title", "price"]
}
Fully Automated Loop

ingest_html: Receives and sanitizes your HTML (or screenshot+DOM).

parse_dom: Builds a structured DOM tree.

call_model: LLM plans navigation steps and proposes selectors.

build_script: Renders those selectors into a Playwright script.

execute_script: Runs it sandboxed, fetches raw data.

validate_output: Verifies completeness; on failure it automatically retries or applies fallback rules.

record_feedback: Logs results (and any auto-fixes) for future model fine-tuning.

No Manual Intervention Required

The agent retries selector generation up to your configured retry limit.

If it still misses the target, you’ll receive an error report—but in most cases (goal: ≥ 90% first-pass success) it completes fully automatically.

Over time, the batch training loop uses logged corrections to make future runs even more reliable.

Operational Considerations

Sandboxing ensures safe, isolated execution every time.

Rate-limiting & Compliance checks (robots.txt, TOS rules) run before execution so you never have to gatekeep manually.

Monitoring alerts you only if something goes truly off-script, but day-to-day it should run hands-free.

In short: once it’s wired up with MCP, all you need is a single API or CLI call—CodeSight will handle the rest, autonomously generating, running, validating, and improving its own scraping scripts.
