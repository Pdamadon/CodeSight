The page is structured with links that likely represent article titles. These links are typically found within a table structure on Hacker News, where each row represents an article. The titles are usually the first link in each row. Comments are linked next to the article titles, often as a separate link indicating the number of comments. Given the semantic structure of Hacker News, using a hierarchical strategy to target these links within the table rows is appropriate."},"correlationId":"scrape_1752035097218_e1gp8ej"}
